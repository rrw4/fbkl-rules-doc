 **I. OVERVIEW**

**1. Summary**

1.  League Configuration

    a.  Franchise Basketball Keeper League (FBKL) is a 12-team
         (separated into 2 divisions) fantasy basketball keeper league
         with salary caps, auctions, and deep rosters.

    b.  There is an annual Veteran Auction and annual Rookie Draft.

2.  Scoring

    a.  Head-to-Head (H2H) weekly matchups (one win per category)

    b.  9 standard categories: Points (PTS), Rebounds (REB), Assists
         (AST), Steals (STL), 3-Pointers (3P), Blocks (BLK), Field Goal
         Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), Turnovers (TO)

    c.  No minimum/maximum games played per week or over the season.

3.  Lineups and Rosters

    a.  Start 1 PG, 1 SG, 2 G, 1 SF, 1 PF, 2 F, 2 C, 3 UTIL (13 total),
         9 bench, 1 IR, 5 Development Squad (up to 27-28 total on
         roster). Position eligibility is determined by the league
         website.

    b.  Weekly lineup changes (one week is Monday-Sunday)

4.  Playoffs

    a.  Playoffs: top 3 teams in each division make playoffs with
         division winners getting byes (Tiebreakers - head to head
         record, division record, wins by category starting with PTS,
         followed by REB, AST, STL, 3P, BLK, FG%, FT%, TO. These
         tiebreakers, in this order, will be used to break any league
         ranking tie.)

    b.  Playoff games will be one week each, and will take place the
         last three full weeks of the season (approximately week 22,
         23, and 24).

**2. Logistics**

1.  League Communication

    a.  All league correspondence and discussion (auction bids, draft
         picks, trade announcements, etc.) will be through a Google
         Group set up for the league.

    b.  All league weekly scoring, lineups, etc. will be done via the
         league website. The roster lock deadline will be determined by
         the league website (usually tipoff of the first game on
         Monday).

    c.  All league records/data, such as salaries and contracts for
         players, rosters, auction results, draft picks, trades, etc.,
         will be recorded in Google Docs shared with everyone in the
         league. Google Docs will be used to track rosters during the
         offseason, Veteran Auction, and Rookie Draft.

2.  Buy-in and Prize Pool

    a.  This will be a money league, with a \$50 yearly entry fee for
         each owner (\$600 total prize pool). The prize pool will be
         distributed each season as follows:

        i.  \$300 for league champion

        ii. \$150 for runner up (lost final)

        iii. \$50 for 3rd place (lost semifinal)

        iv. \$50 for 4th place (lost semifinal)

        v.  \$50 for regular season champion

    b.  If an owner is not returning for the next year, league winnings
         to that owner will only be paid out after a replacement owner
         for his team is found.

    c.  For the first year, a \$25 down payment from each owner must be
         made, which will be returned after the second year if the
         owner returns for the third year. If the owner does not return
         for the second or third year, the down payment will be
         returned only if a replacement owner (willing to pay the
         league entry fee) can be found for the vacated team. This
         policy will apply to any new or replacement owners. This is in
         place to ensure that an owner does not mortgage his future to
         try to win one year (by dealing picks and prospects for
         established players), and then leave the league with a poor
         team (without much as far as keepers and picks go) that a
         replacement owner would not want to take over.

    d.  If the league is dissolved for any reason, any money held by the
         commissioner will be repaid in appropriate prizes or returned
         as entry fees.

3.  Rules Changes

    a.  Rules changes are at the discretion of the commissioner, but at
         the least will be implemented for the next season (rules will
         not change for the current season), or in some cases for
         significant strategic rules changes, after two or more seasons
         to allow owners to adjust their long-term strategy/plans.

    b.  Any significant rules changes or additions (see *19. Possible
         Future Rules Changes* below) will be put to a league vote
         before being implemented. The required vote (majority, 2/3
         majority, unanimous, etc.) is at the discretion of the
         commissioner.

4.  Replacement Owners

    a.  If an owner wants to quit the league, ownership of his team will
         be transferred to a replacement owner as soon as possible. If
         this occurs during the season, the owner’s entry fees for the
         current year will not be repaid and will be used by the
         replacement owner.

    b.  An owner may be forced to quit the league at the commissioner’s
         discretion; this would only be in extreme cases of repeated
         collusive trading, inactivity, or other actions that severely
         disrupt the competitive balance of the league. In this case, a
         replacement owner would be found for his team, and entry fees
         would not be repaid.

    c.  Replacement owners will preferably come from friends of owners
         in the league.

    d.  If after any one season, more than one team needs a replacement
         owner, there may be a replacement owners draft at the
         commissioner’s discretion. This would allow the replacement
         owners to draft from the combined pool of players from the
         abandoned teams. All players would retain the salary and years
         in contract they previously had. The logistics of this draft
         will be determined if and when the commissioner deems such a
         draft necessary.

**3. Terminology**

1.  Definitions

    a.  “Contract” refers to the number of years the player has been a
         kept by a team. There are no actual contracts in this league,
         in the sense of having a fixed salary commitment to a player
         over multiple years. This league essentially has one-year
         contracts for all players with an option that increases the
         player salary to keep him next year, with restrictions on how
         many years a player may be kept.

    b.  “Having been on an active NBA roster” is defined by an NBA entry
         for the player in basketball-reference.com. A player does not
         necessarily have to have NBA game minutes logged, he may have
         just been on an NBA roster but not played in a game. Any
         further questions over whether a player is classified as
         having previously been on an active NBA roster (for
         auction/draft purposes) will be decided by the commissioner.

    c.  “League website” refers to the league hosting website (most
         likely ESPN or Yahoo), and not the league’s Google Group.

    d.  “Original owner” for the purposes of who owns a player’s RFA/UFA
         exception, is the owner of the player at the time of the
         keeper deadline, when keepers are declared and RFAs/UFAs
         announced. See *15. Restricted Free Agents (RFA)* and *16.
         Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA)*.

 **II. LEAGUE CONFIGURATION**

**4. Salary Cap**

1.  Rules

    a.  All owners must adhere to the salary cap at all times (when
         valid) – the sum of the salaries of all players on a roster
         must be equal or less than the salary cap.

    b.  There is no minimum salary cap, only a maximum.

    c.  The salary cap and all salary cap/auction values are fictitious
         dollars, they are not associated with real dollar amounts in
         any way. The only involvement of real money is for entry fees
         and winnings as outlined in *2. Logistics* above.

2.  Salary Cap by Period

    a.  \$200 immediately after keeper deadline and during Veteran
         Auction and Rookie Draft

    b.  \$210 (increases \$10) after conclusion of the Veteran Auction
         and Rookie Draft

    c.  \$230 (increases \$20) immediately after FA pickups freeze week
         20 (two weeks before trade deadline/playoffs begin in week
         22), stays at \$230 until the conclusion of the playoffs

    d.  There is no cap between the conclusion of the playoffs and the
         keeper deadline.

3.  Penalties

    a.  Salary cap can be reduced by dropping players during the season
         and taking drop penalties (see *9. Player Drops*). The drop
         penalties will occur based off of an owner’s current salary
         cap, and will not be carried over into the next season.

**5. Roster Limits**

1.  In-Season

    a.  The in-season roster limit is 22 players, with an Injured
         Reserve slot and 5 man Development Squad (23 total including
         IR, 28 total including IR and DS).

    b.  At the time of the roster cut deadline shortly before the
         regular season starts, all owners must make their rosters
         legal to the in-season roster limits by moving a player to the
         IR slot, trades, or drops. Any drops made at this time incur
         drop penalties as usual, except for players drafted in that
         year’s Rookie Draft (see *Player Drops*).

    c.  A player may be moved directly to IR from the offseason 30 man
         roster; it is not necessary to accommodate him on the 22 man
         active roster first. This is the only time when this will be
         possible; during the season, a player added to the IR via
         trade or free agency must be added to the 22 man active roster
         first.

2.  Offseason

    a.  The offseason roster limit (the roster limit from when the
         season ends, to shortly before the regular season starts) is
         30 players (includes Rookie-Development players), with no IR
         slot.

**III. VETERAN AUCTION AND ROOKIE DRAFT**

**6. Veteran Auction:**

1.  Overview

    a.  The Veteran Auction is held every year and is the only way to
         acquire free agent veterans before the season begins.

    b.  Any players not bid on in the Veteran Auction will be free
         agents available for bidding during the season.

2.  Player Pool

    a.  All NBA veterans (players who have been on an active NBA roster
         at any point in their career) are eligible to be bid on in the
         Veteran Auction.

    b.  The veteran auction pool is made up of Free Agents, Unrestricted
         Free Agents, and Restricted Free Agents.

        i.  Free Agents (FA) were either not previously owned, or the
             original owner did not keep the player for a maximum three
             years (if signed via veteran auction) or maximum five
             years (if signed via Rookie Draft), or the player was an
             unbid on RFA that was not re-signed.

        ii. Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA) were previously owned either
             up to the 3 year maximum contract (if signed via Veteran
             Auction), or the 5 year maximum contract (if signed via
             Rookie Draft). The original owner is allowed to
             participate in an auction for a UFA. UFAs have veteran
             exceptions, which are re-signing discounts for the
             original owner (see *16. Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA)*
             below for more details).

        iii. Restricted Free Agents (RFA) were previously owned for a 3
             year contract and signed via the rookie draft. The
             original owners are not allowed to participate in the
             auction for a RFA, but they have a RFA exception, which is
             a re-signing discount. If the owner declines to re-sign
             the RFA, the winner of the auction must forfeit a rookie
             draft pick for next year, based on the final bid value. If
             there are any RFAs, the first week of the Veteran Auction
             is set aside only for RFA auctions. This is the only time
             when RFAs may be opened for auction. Any RFAs not bid on
             during this time and declined the standard 4th year salary
             by the original owner will be released into the regular
             Veteran Auction as a standard Free Agent. See *15.
             Restricted Free Agents (RFA)*.

3.  Schedule

    a.  Restricted Free Agents (RFAs) will be auctioned the first week
         of the Veteran Auction, before all other free agents are
         available for auction. The first week will be the only time
         when RFAs may be opened. Since RFAs are for players in the 4th
         year of a rookie contract, this first week of RFA bidding will
         start in the fourth year of the league.

    b.  The Veteran Auction will have a set auction schedule, with the
         top 150 non-rookie players as pre-determined by a public
         ranking website (ESPN, Yahoo, Rotowire, Fantasy Basketball
         Café, etc.), with keepers omitted, auctioned first. After the
         initial 150 players have been auctioned, open nominations will
         begin, with owners allowed to nominate any remaining veteran
         free agents. The veteran free agent pool includes any
         Unrestricted Free Agents (UFAs).

    c.  The number of players available for auction each day will follow
         a set schedule. Only players that have been released into the
         auction pool per the schedule will be eligible to be bid on.

    d.  The minimum bid for players will follow a set schedule. Players
         will be slotted into minimum bid tiers; however, if the player
         is not bid on with this minimum bid, he will slide into the
         next tier with a lower minimum bid. This is done to limit the
         emails necessary to get to a player’s final bid.

    e.  When a player slides into the next minimum bid tier, this does
         not affect players already in that tier (the last player in
         that tier will not move down a tier).

    f.  The exact auction schedule, number of players available each
         day, and minimum bid tiers will be different each season based
         on the number of players available in the Veteran Auction (not
         kept from previous year). These will be set prior to the start
         of the Veteran Auction each year.

4.  Auction mechanics

    a.  A bid is valid only if (1) the bidding owner has enough cap
         remaining to make the bid, including the value of all of his
         currently winning bids and (2) the bidding owner has enough
         open roster space available, including players for which he is
         the current winning bidder. If these two conditions are not
         satisfied when a bid is made, the bid is null and void, and
         the previous bid is still the active and winning bid.

    b.  Minimum bid increment is \$1 at all times.

    c.  An opening bid on a player must be equal to or greater than his
         minimum bid value.

    d.  Auctions are open as long as there has been a bid in the last 24
         hours of the auction. After 24 hours have elapsed since the
         last bid in an auction, the auction is concluded and the
         player is awarded to the last bidder at a salary equal to the
         final bid, subject to any UFA/RFA exceptions.

    e.  Trades are allowed during the Veteran Auction.

    f.  Players already on an owner’s roster (keepers and already
         acquired players) may not be dropped during the Veteran
         Auction.

**7. Rookie Draft:**

1.  Overview

    a.  The Rookie Draft is held every year after the Veteran Auction,
         and is the only way to acquire rookies before the season
         begins.

    b.  Starting in the 2012 rookie draft (year 3), the rookie draft
         rules will change significantly, with the addition of the
         Development Squad (see *11. Development Squad*), and lowered
         rookie salaries (see below). Drafted rookies will have
         Rookie-Development (RD) contracts, and be eligible for the
         Development Squad.

2.  Structure and Draft Order

    a.  The Rookie Draft is five rounds, with a 1st round lottery order
         for nonplayoff teams followed by playoff finish for playoff
         teams (for teams getting knocked out in same round, use
         regular season record to determine order between the two),
         while rounds 2-5 are in reverse order of regular season finish
         2/3 of the way through the season (after Week 16) for
         non-playoff teams, followed by reverse order of playoff finish
         for playoff teams. The order for rounds 2-5 will be the same
         for each round.

    b.  The six non-playoff teams enter a draft lottery, with chance to
         get 1st pick based on record 2/3 of the way through the season
         (after Week 16). Draft lottery assigns picks 1-6 in the 1st
         round. The draft lottery will give the worst non-playoff team
         the highest chance of the 1st overall pick, and the best
         non-playoff team the lowest chance of the 1st overall pick.
         The lottery will take place shortly after the conclusion of
         the regular season, and will be done using
         DraftPickLottery.com.

3.  Draft mechanics

    a.  An owner may pass on as many of his picks as desired.

    b.  In order to make a pick, an owner must have an open roster slot
         available. The owner does not need to have open cap space,
         since rookies are drafted as Rookie-Development contracts.

    c.  Trades and drops (with the associated cap penalty) are allowed
         during the Rookie Draft.

    d.  A player dropped during the Rookie Draft may not be drafted
         during that same Rookie Draft (even if still eligible). For
         example, if an owner drafts Ricky Rubio during the 2010 Rookie
         Draft, he may not drop Rubio right before his 5th round pick
         in the 2011 Rookie Draft and draft him again (even though
         Rubio is still eligible for that rookie draft) and reset his
         salary to \$1. Such a player drafted would be eligible for
         in-season free agency, or the next year’s rookie draft, if he
         retains eligibility.

    e.  Free agent bids are not allowed during the Rookie Draft.

4.  Salaries and Contracts

    a.  All rookie draft picks have a fixed salary. The salary is as
         follows:

        i.  1st round: \$4

        ii. 2nd round: \$3

        iii. 3rd round: \$2

        iv. 4th round: \$1

        v.  5th round: \$1

    b.  Rookies are drafted as a Rookie-Development (RD) contract. Once
         the season begins, they may be moved to the active roster and
         become standard R contracts.

    c.  A player drafted as a rookie has a maximum 3 year contract.
         After the 3rd year in the contract, the player is released
         into the veteran auction pool as a restricted free agent
         (RFA). As an RFA, the original owner gets an RFA exception as
         detailed under *15. Restricted Free Agents (RFA)*.

    d.  If a drafted rookie is dropped before the start of the season
         (when roster limits go to 22 + 1 IR) in the year that he is
         drafted, the owner does not incur the usual 20% drop penalty.
         This is only if the rookie is dropped before the start of the
         season; if he is dropped in-season or any point afterward as
         an R contract, the owner incurs the 20% drop penalty as usual.

5.  Player Pool

    a.  The below players are eligible to be drafted in the Rookie
         Draft:

        i.  Rookies drafted in the NBA rookie draft for that year

        ii. Players that declared for the NBA draft and went undrafted

        iii. Players playing in summer league that have never been on an
             active NBA roster

        iv. Players playing in the NBDL that have never been on an
             active NBA roster

        v.  Foreign players that have been previously drafted by an NBA
             team that have never been on an active NBA roster

        vi. Former American college players (drafted or undrafted)
             playing overseas that have never been on an active NBA
             roster.

    b.  The below players are ineligible to be drafted in the Rookie
         Draft:

        i.  Any player that has been on an active NBA roster at any
             point in his career

        ii. College players not covered in the above list of eligible
             players

        iii. High school or other players not covered in the above list
             of eligible players

        iv. Foreign players not covered in the above list of eligible
             players

 **IV. IN-SEASON**

**8. In-Season Free Agency**

1.  Overview

    a.  Free agency opens starting at tipoff for the first game(s) of
         the week on Monday.

    b.  For Week 1 free agency, where there is no first game(s) of the
         week, the free agency opening time will be determined during
         the preseason.

    c.  Week 20 (two weeks before the trade deadline) will be the pickup
         freeze. After free agency concludes for week 20, pickups will
         no longer be allowed for the rest of the season (including
         playoffs), and the salary cap will expand \$20, from \$210 to
         \$230.

2.  Deadlines

    a.  There are two bid deadlines each week, an opening bid deadline,
         and an all bid deadline. The opening bid deadline is the last
         time an owner can open an auction on a free agent (any free
         agent that hasn’t been bid on yet). The all bid deadline is
         the last time an owner can bid on any currently open auction
         (any free agent for who an auction has already been opened).

    b.  The deadlines for each week are below:

        i.  opening bids: Friday 12:00 PM CT

        ii. all bids: Sunday 8:00 PM CT

3.  Free Agency mechanics

    a.  Any open auction that has not been bid on in the last 24 hours
         is won by the last owner who made a bid for that auction.

    b.  If a player is bid on within the last hour before the all bid
         deadline (Sunday 7:00 PM-8:00 PM CT), the bid deadline is
         extended 30 minutes. If there is a bid within the 30 minute
         extension, the bid deadline is extended another 30 minutes,
         until there are no bids within the last 30 minutes.

    c.  Minimum opening bid is \$1, unless the player was previously
         owned the current year, in that case the minimum opening bid
         will be his previous salary.

    d.  Minimum bid increment is \$1 at all times.

    e.  Any player won via auction must be picked up by the winning
         owner, and any drops/trades must be made in order to
         accommodate the pickup. An owner is not limited to any salary
         cap limitations when bidding on a player; he may bid above the
         free cap he has available, as long as drops/trades are made
         accordingly if he wins the player, to free up cap space. A
         player won via auction also cannot be dropped immediately; he
         must be legally accommodated on the owner’s roster first.

    f.  After a player is won via auction, the owner must pick him up on
         the league website. The player is added to the owner’s roster
         and may be played (added to starting lineup) the next week.

    g.  All players added in a single week, must be added to the owner’s
         roster legally before being dropped, and players added in a
         single week may not be dropped to accommodate another player
         added that week.

        i.  Example: Joe wins Brandon Jennings for \$7 and Aaron Gray
             for \$1 in Week 2. He must add both Brandon Jennings and
             Aaron Gray for that week; he may not add Aaron Gray, then
             drop him to make space and add Brandon Jennings after
             that. However, he is free to drop either Jennings or Gray
             after they are both legally added to his roster.

    h.  Once a player(s) is won in auction, owners must send out an FA
         report email to the Google Group, specifying his pickups and
         drops for the week, and his new salary cap figures after
         pickups/drops.

4.  Eligibility

    a.  Any players (including rookies) that were eligible in the
         Veteran Auction or the Rookie Draft, are eligible for bidding.
         This includes: any NBA veterans (has been on an active NBA
         roster at any point in his career), NBA rookies (drafted or
         undrafted), NBDL players, previously drafted foreign players,
         and former American collegiates playing overseas.

    b.  All players that were ineligible for the Veteran Auction and
         Rookie Draft are still ineligible for In-Season Free Agency.
         This includes: current college or high school players, and
         foreign players that were not previously drafted and not
         former American collegiates.

5.  Examples

    a.  Bidding example (all times are CT):

        i.  Joe open bids on Brandon Jennings for \$1 on Thursday at
             6:00 PM (if no bids on Jennings by Friday 6:00 PM, Joe
             wins Jennings for \$1).

        ii. Bob bids on Brandon Jennings for \$2 on Friday at 2:00 PM.

        iii. Joe bids on Brandon Jennings for \$3 on Saturday at 10:52
             AM.

        iv. Bob bids on Brandon Jennings for \$4 on Sunday at 9:00 AM.

        v.  Joe bids on Brandon Jennings for \$5 on Sunday at 7:15 PM.
             Since the bid is within the last hour of bidding, the bid
             deadline is extended 30 minutes to 8:30 PM.

        vi. Bob bids on Brandon Jennings for \$6 on Sunday at 7:42 PM.
             The bid deadline is still 8:30 PM.

        vii. Joe bids on Brandon Jennings for \$7 on Sunday at 8:13 PM.
             Since the bid is within the 30 minute extension, the bid
             deadline is extended another 30 minutes, to 9:00 PM.

        viii. No more bids by 9:00 PM. Joe wins Brandon Jennings for
             \$7. If there had been another bid between 8:30 PM and
             9:00 PM, the bid deadline would be extended another 30
             minutes, to 9:30 PM.

    b.  The above example is just to illustrate the bid extension rule;
         the vast majority of free agents will most likely not have the
         bidding go down to the deadline, primarily because auction
         bids are active only for 24 hours. Thus, the earlier in the
         week a bid is made, the more likely the auction will finish
         earlier in the week.

**9. Player Drops**

1.  Penalties

    a.  If a non-RD player is dropped at any point after the keeper
         deadline (does not include players that just aren’t kept from
         one season to the next), the owner dropping the player takes a
         drop penalty, losing 20% of the player’s salary (rounded up)
         in salary cap.

        i.  example 1: Joe drops Blake Griffin (\$26) when his cap is
             \$196/\$200. Joe takes a drop penalty of .20\*\$26 =
             \$5.20 rounded up to \$6, so his total salary and cap
             after the drop is \$170/\$194.

        ii. example 2: Bob drops Aaron Gray (\$1) when his cap is
             \$186/\$191. Bob takes a drop penalty of .20\*\$1 = \$.20
             rounded up to \$1, so his total salary and cap after the
             drop is \$185/\$190.

    b.  Salaries may not be combined for the purposes of calculating
         drop penalties. For example, if you drop an \$8 player and a
         \$7 player, they each have \$2 drop penalties (.20 \* \$8 =
         \$1.60 rounded up to \$2, .20 \* \$7 = \$1.40 rounded up to
         \$2); you cannot add their salaries to \$15 and then have a
         \$3 drop penalty (.20 \* \$15 = \$3).

    c.  The salary cap penalties accrue for each owner as players are
         dropped during the season, but do not carry in to the next
         season. At the start of the next season, everyone’s salary cap
         goes back to \$200 before the Veteran Auction.

    d.  Nick Adenhart rule: if a player dies in-season, or at any time
         between the declaration of keepers and the start of the
         season, the owner of that player may drop him immediately
         without any salary cap penalty.

    e.  RD players may be dropped without penalty.

2.  Dropped Players

    a.  Dropped players retain the salary they had before they were
         dropped, as a minimum starting bid for in-season free agent
         auctions. After the season is over, all dropped players return
         to the veteran auction pool and no longer have a minimum
         starting bid (will be slotted into tiers as usual). Salaries
         for dropped players in-season will be tracked via a google
         spreadsheet.

    b.  Dropped players are released into the free agent pool the week
         after they are dropped, and may be bid on by any owner with a
         starting minimum bid of the player’s salary before he was
         dropped.

**10. Injured Reserve**

1.  Overview

    a.  One injured reserve (IR) slot will be used as it is normally on
         the league website. Only players on the NBA IR can be used in
         the IR slot.

    b.  The only time a player may be added directly to the IR without
         being accommodated on the 22 man roster first is when the
         season begins and roster limits go from 30 with no IR to 22 +
         1 IR.

    c.  A player can be kept in the IR slot (and continue to have his IR
         exception) after he comes off the NBA IR, however, if any
         pickups or trades are made, the player must be moved off of
         the IR to the active roster and accommodated accordingly
         (drop/trade a player to make room for him). IR eligibility
         will be determined by the league website.

    d.  After the season concludes, the roster limits go to 30 players
         with no IR. Any players on IR must be either moved to the
         active roster or dropped.

2.  Injured Player Exception

    a.  The player in the IR slot has an Injured Player exception. This
         player’s salary does not count against the cap. When the
         player is reactivated and moved to the active roster, he
         counts fully against the cap, and trades/drops must be made to
         accommodate his salary, just as if he were acquired otherwise.

3.  Trades and Adds/Drops

    a.  A player may not be added directly to the IR after being
         acquired in in-season free agency or in-season trade (even if
         he is IR-eligible). If he is acquired in-season, he must first
         be accommodated on the 22 man active roster (with the
         appropriate trades/drops necessary to free up roster or cap
         space), then moved to the IR after that if desired.

    b.  If a player on IR is traded, he must be moved off of the IR to
         the active roster and accommodated accordingly (drop/trade a
         player to make room for him).

    c.  A player may be dropped directly from the IR without being
         accommodated on the active roster first, however, the standard
         cap penalty will still be applied when he is dropped. If this
         causes an illegal cap situation (where salary cap is less than
         total salaries), drops/trades must be made until the roster is
         legal again.

**11. Development Squad**

1.  Overview

    a.  Starting in the 2012-2013 season, we will add a 5-player
         development squad (DS). The development squad will be used to
         stash drafted rookies and is intended to put greater emphasis
         on the rookie draft and scouting long-term talent.

    b.  Players on the development squad do not count against the cap,
         do not take up roster space (other than the 5-player DS
         limit), do not incur drop penalties, and do not have normal
         salary increases (salary stays the same if kept to next
         season).

    c.  Development squad players may not be used in the starting
         lineup.

    d.  Once a player is activated from the development squad to the
         active roster, he may not be moved back to the development
         squad.

2.  Rookie-Development (RD) Contract Type

    a.  There is a new contract type, Rookie-Development (RD), in
         addition to current contract types, Rookie (R) and Veteran
         (V). An RD contract indicates that player is on the
         development squad.

    b.  All drafted rookies are immediately designated as RD players.

    c.  Only RD players can be on the development squad, and only
         drafted rookies are RD players.

3.  Effect on Roster Limits

    a.  Offseason roster limit is 30 players (including any RD players);
         once the season starts, must designate usual 22 man active
         roster, in addition to max 1 IR, and max 5 development squad.

    b.  Owners may own more than 5 RD players during the offseason, but
         will only be able to have max of 5 players on the
         development squad once the season begins. Any RD players
         beyond the 5-player DS limit can be released without penalty,
         or moved to active roster (changed to R contract, and now take
         up roster/cap space, incur drop penalties, and have normal
         salary increases).

    c.  Declaring in-season roster of 22 active/1 IR/5
         development squad takes place simultaneously, so owners are
         allowed to move an injured player to IR, then activate any RD
         player(s) beyond the 5-player DS limit, to take up the vacated
         cap/roster space to begin the season.  This occurs before the
         \$210 cap expansion at the start of the season.

4.  Activation

    a.  To activate a development squad player (to add him to starting
         lineup, or because you are adding another RD player via trade
         and will be above the 5-player DS limit), it is similar to
         activating an IR player (must make cap/roster room, and
         drop/trade players if necessary). The player is no longer
         eligible for development squad, incurs drop penalties, and has
         normal salary increases. That player's contract is now changed
         to a first year rookie (R) contract at the same salary as
         before, even if the player was a 2nd or 3rd year RD player.

5.  Injured Reserve

    a.  RD players can not be added to IR, directly as an RD player. 
         However, you may activate the RD player (changing his contract
         to R, and opening up cap/roster space as usual), then IR him
         immediately.

6.  Trades

    a.  RD players may be traded directly from the development squad (do
         not need to be activated first, unlike IR players).  When
         acquiring an RD player via trade, the new owner may add him to
         his development squad or activate the player (change to R
         contract, must make cap/roster space) immediately, without
         having to add the player to his development squad first.  If
         adding the player to development squad and already at the
         5-player limit, then must activate another RD player, or drop
         an RD player to make room.  There are no restrictions on
         number of RD players involved in a trade, trading RD players
         for active roster players, trading RD players for picks, etc.

7.  Drops

    a.  RD players dropped from developmental squad do not incur the
         usual 20% drop penalty.  Dropped RD players retain their
         salary as minimum bid in in-season free agency for the rest of
         the season, just like other (Rookie/Veteran) players.

    b.  If dropped RD players are bid on in in-season free agency, they
         are added as first year V contracts, like any other players
         added in in-season free agency.

8.  Keepers

    a.  Contract year for RD players increment each year, just like R
         and V contracts.

    b.  RD players have the usual 3-year keeper max, but as mentioned
         previously, do not have the usual 20% salary increase.  After
         3 years, any player that is still on an RD contract, has his
         contract changed to a 2nd year R contract for the next season
         (4th year of the player in the league). That player now counts
         as an R contract that counts against the keeper limits and may
         be kept/not kept like any other R or V contract.

    c.  RD players do not count under the 14 player/\$100 cap keeper
         max.  Beyond the 14 player/\$100 cap keeper max, you may keep
         as many RD players as desired (will only be \5 if an owner
         acquires RD players via trade after the previous season has
         completed).  However, as mentioned above, once the next season
         begins, there is a max of 5 players on the development squad.

9.  Example activation/keeper transitions

    a.  Below are some example activation/keeper contract transitions to
         illustrate the activation and keeper rules in sections 11.4
         and 11.8, and how the player transitions to an RFA. The
         scenario is listed along with the contract changes each year
         if the player is kept for the maximum amount of time. An arrow
         indicates an activation with the resulting new contract type.

        i.  Activated during year 1. Year 1: RD/1-\R/1, Year 2: R/2,
             Year 3: R/3, Year 4: RFA

        ii. Activated during year 2. Year 1: RD/1, Year 2: RD/2-\R/1,
             Year 3: R/2, Year 4: R/3, Year 5: RFA

        iii. Activated during year 3. Year 1: RD/1, Year 2: RD/2, Year
             3: RD/3-\R/1, Year 4: R/2, Year 5: R/3, Year 6: RFA

        iv. Held for max 3 years as RD: Year 1: RD/1, Year 2: RD/2, Year
             3: RD/3, Year 4: R/2, Year 5: R/3, Year 6: RFA

10. Logistics

    a.  The rosters sheet will have an added section for
         development squad, under the IR section.  These players will
         not count against the cap/roster limit tally.

    b.  Roster reports will be as usual, with an added DS part for your
         roster state, stating how many DS players you have.

    c.  Roster report examples for various DS moves, starting at
         \$205/\$210, 21/22 + 1 IR + 3/5 DS, with Xavier Henry \$2 as a
         RD player:

        i.  activating Xavier Henry: \$207/\$210, 22/22 + 1 IR + 2/5 DS

        ii. dropping Xavier Henry: \$205/\$210, 21/22 + 1 IR + 2/5 DS
             (no drop penalty)

        iii. trading Xavier Henry for picks: \$205/\$210, 21/22 + 1 IR +
             2/5 DS

        iv. adding Lance Stephenson \$1 RD via trade for picks (still
             have Henry): \$205/\$210, 21/22 + 1 IR + 4/5 DS

        v.  adding Lance Stephenson \$1 RD via trade, in exchange for
             Henry: \$205/\$210, 21/22 + 1 IR + 3/5 DS

**12. Trades**

1.  Overview

    a.  Players and picks are the only assets that may be traded. Cap
         space may not be traded, although that may change in future
         years (see *Future Possibilities* below).

    b.  All trade conditions and agreements must be made public to the
         league at the announcement of the trade.

    c.  Trades must be “atomic”, in the sense that all transactions
         within a trade may not be interrupted by an outside
         transaction, if that trade would no longer be legal on its own
         merits.

    d.  Since this league involves player salaries where there is a cap
         penalty for dropping a player, there will likely be players
         that are negative assets to an owner (not worth his salary).
         Thus, there are some situations where an owner would want to
         give away a player for free (which is usually preferable to
         dropping the player, if someone else wants him). Thus, trades
         where there is only a one-way transfer of a player or players
         (and possibly in addition to other assets) are allowed.

2.  Logistics

    a.  Trades must be announced on the Google Group, with all parties
         involved confirming the trade.

    b.  After the trade is announced and confirmed on the Google Group,
         the involved owners can execute the trade (offer and accept)
         on the league website.

    c.  After a trade is finalized, and any accompanying drops made, all
         owners involved must send out a trade report email to the
         Google Group, specifying his roster changes for the week, and
         his new salary cap figures after adds/trades/drops.

3.  Trade Deadline

    a.  The trade deadline will be at roster lock the first week of the
         playoffs (approximately week 22). After the trade deadline, no
         trades are allowed until after the conclusion of the playoffs.

4.  Picks

    a.  Picks may be traded up to two years in advance. The next year
         for purposes of draft pick trading is considered to have begun
         immediately after the conclusion of the Rookie Draft.
         Examples:

        i.  Prior to and during the 2010 rookie draft, 2010 rookie draft
             picks and 2011 rookie draft picks may be traded.

        ii. After the conclusion of the 2010 rookie draft, 2011 rookie
             draft picks and 2012 rookie draft picks may now be traded.

5.  Trade types

    a.  Conditional trades are allowed only for draft pick position.
         Player performance (certain \# of points or rebounds, etc.)
         and team performance (certain record, making playoffs, etc)
         conditions are not allowed. Some examples of allowed
         conditional trades:

        i.  Bob trades Derrick Rose to Joe for Joe’s 2011 1st round pick
             if his first rounder is between picks 1-3, or Joe’s 2011
             1st round pick and 2011 4th round pick otherwise.

        ii. Bob trades Derrick Rose to Joe for Joe’s 2011 1st round pick
             if his first rounder is between picks 7-12, or Joe’s 2011
             2nd round pick and 2011 3rd round pick otherwise.

    b.  Multi-owner trades are allowed.

    c.  Multi-part trades or players to be named later (where one
         element of the trade is executed at a different time than the
         rest) are not allowed. This excludes trades involving
         conditions previously mentioned that are expressly allowed.

    d.  Player rental trades (where a player is traded to a team for a
         pre-determined amount of time) are not allowed.

6.  Collusion

    a.  Collusion is not allowed. Since this is a deep keeper league
         with salary caps and future considerations at play in any
         trade, evaluating trade equity is not as simple as in a
         regular redraft league. There will be no league voting for
         approving or vetoing trades; any trade veto is at the
         discretion of the commissioner. Since everyone in this league
         is a personal friend of at least one other person in this
         league, there is a trust that everyone will compete with their
         team’s best interests in mind. There will generally be no
         trade restrictions other than what is listed above, and a
         trade will be vetoed only in extreme cases after careful
         deliberation and discussion with the owners involved. If any
         owners are found to be colluding in a trade, all involved
         parties will be terminated from the league immediately without
         return of entry fees, and replacement owners found for their
         teams.

**13. Weekly Moves**

1.  Explanation

    a.  All in-season transactions (adds, drops, IR moves, trades, and
         starting in the 2012-2013 season, Development Squad
         activation) are made in a weekly timeframe. Transactions in a
         single week may be re-ordered in any way an owner wants.

    b.  Any complex sequences of weekly moves that may result in illegal
         transactions will be ruled on by the commissioner. Any such
         illegal transactions will have to be reverted.

    c.  <span id="h.gjdgxs" class="anchor"</spanDuring a single week,
         there may be roster states that are currently illegal – e.g.
         winning a player in auction without having yet dropped a
         player to open up roster space. This is fine as long the
         roster state is legal by the end of the week (Sunday
         night/Monday morning, prior to Monday roster lock). Rosters
         and other documents should be updated at the end of each week
         to reflect all transactions during that week.

 **V. KEEPERS AND RFA/UFA**

**14. Keepers:**

1.  Restrictions

    a.  Each team’s keepers must adhere to these restrictions:

        i.  Maximum 14 players (not counting RD players)

        ii. Maximum \$100 total cap (after salary increases)

        iii. There is no limit to the number of RD players that can be
             kept.

    b.  These restrictions will be in place at least the first year for
         balancing reasons. They may be relaxed or removed later on if
         there is a push for more freedom with keepers. Any change to
         the keeper restrictions will be enforced at least a full
         season after they are agreed upon.

2.  Salary Increases

    a.  Player salaries increase each year for kept players (except for
         RD contracts), with the amount of the increase based on the
         previous year’s salary. Salaries will increase the next year
         by 20% of current year salary, rounded up. Examples:

        i.  Chris Paul’s 2009 salary is \$51. If he is kept for 2010,
             his salary goes up 20% of \$51 rounded up (.20\*\$51 =
             \$10.20, rounded up to \$11); his 2010 salary will be
             \$51 + \$11 = \$62.

        ii. Derrick Rose’s 2009 salary is \$20. If he is kept for 2010,
             his salary goes up 20% of \$20 rounded up (.20\*\$20 =
             \$4); his 2010 salary will be \$20 + \$4 = \$24.

        iii. Blake Griffin’s 2009 salary is \$4. If he is kept for 2010,
             his salary goes up 20% of \$4 rounded up (.20\*\$4 =
             \$.80, rounded up to \$1); his 2010 salary will be \$4 +
             \$1 = \$5.

        iv. Aaron Gray’s 2009 salary is \$1. If he is kept for 2010, his
             salary goes up 20% of \$1 rounded up (.20\*\$1 = \$.20,
             rounded up to \$1); his 2010 salary will be \$1 + \$1 =
             \$2.

    b.  Player salaries for RD contracts remain the same.

3.  Contract Years

    a.  Each player that is kept is now in the nth year of the contract,
         where n = number of years since the player was signed via the
         Veteran Auction or Rookie Draft, including the year in which
         he was signed. The maximum contract length is subject to the
         constraints outlined below.

    b.  A player signed through the veteran auction has a maximum 3 year
         contract (maximum 3 years in a contract, including trades,
         before he is not allowed to be kept). After the 3rd year in
         the contract, the player is released into the veteran auction
         pool as a unrestricted free agent (UFA). The original owner is
         allowed to bid on a UFA. As a UFA, he will be slotted into the
         Veteran Auction as if he were a normal free agent; however,
         the original owner gets a veteran exception as detailed under
         *16. Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA)*.

    c.  A player signed via in-season free agency is considered to be in
         year 1 of his contract. Thus, if a player is signed towards
         the end of a season before the in-season free agency freeze,
         then kept into next season, he is now in year 2 of his
         contract.

4.  Deadline

    a.  Keepers will be declared by a specified deadline, shortly before
         the start of the veteran auction. Each owner decides which of
         his keeper-eligible players he will be keeping with the salary
         increase, with all non-kept players released into the Veteran
         Auction.

    b.  The keeper deadline is also when RFAs and UFAs are announced.
         The owners of any players that are ineligible to be kept (3rd
         and 5th year players) will have their RFA/UFA exceptions for
         the next Veteran Auction. See *15. Restricted Free Agents
         (RFA)* and *16. Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA)*.

**15. Restricted Free Agents (RFA)**

1.  Explanation

    a.  Restricted Free Agent (RFA): Player that is coming off 3rd year
         of a R contract. This player may not be kept at the standard
         20% salary increase and goes into the Veteran Auction as an
         RFA, with the original owner getting an RFA Exception as
         detailed below.

2.  RFA Exception

    a.  RFA Exception: Once the auction for the player is concluded, the
         original owner gets an RFA exception and is allowed to re-sign
         the player at a 10% discount (rounded up) off the final bid
         (after any optional raise from the winning bidder), with a
         minimum of the 4th year salary (3rd year salary + usual
         increase). If the owner declines to do so, the winning bidder
         signs the player for a salary equal to the final bid, and
         forfeits a rookie draft pick as compensation to the original
         owner, based on the final bid as below:

        i.  final bid \$13 or less: 5th round or better

        ii. final bid \$14-\$22: 4th round or better

        iii. final bid \$23-\$33: 3rd round or better

        iv. final bid \$34-\$46: 2nd round or better

        v.  final bid \$47+: 1st round

    b.  Note: “or better” in this case means if the winning owner does
         not have a pick in the given round, he can give up an earlier
         round pick instead. A pick in this case is any pick in the
         given round; it does not necessarily have to be the owner’s
         original pick. If the winning owner has multiple picks in the
         round required, he may choose which pick to forfeit. The pick
         must be in the upcoming rookie draft. The pick is forfeited
         immediately at the conclusion of the player’s auction. Any
         draft picks acquired via trade after the winning bid was made
         are not eligible to be transferred as a compensatory pick. The
         time of a trade is defined as the time that the email was sent
         to announce the trade (not the confirmation email), and time
         of the winning bid is defined as the time that the email was
         sent that ended up winning the auction (not 24 hours later,
         when the auction is officially over, and not when the raise
         decision is made by the winning owner).

        i.  example: Joe has Blake Griffin in the 4th year of his
             contract at \$10 (\$5 original salary through rookie
             draft, +\$1 for second year = \$6, +\$2 third year =
             \$8, +\$2 for fourth year = \$10). Griffin is released
             into the veteran auction pool as a RFA with a starting bid
             of \$10. Griffin’s auction concludes with a final bid of
             \$27 by Bob. Joe now has the option of signing Griffin to
             a 4th year with an RFA exception of .10\*\$27 = \$2.70,
             rounded up to \$3 (thus, he would sign Griffin for \$24).
             Or, he can decline to re-sign Griffin, in which case Bob
             wins Griffin at \$27, and forfeits a 3rd round pick or
             better to Joe.

        ii. example: Joe has Derrick Rose in the 4th year of his
             contract at \$10 (\$5 original salary through rookie
             draft, +\$1 for second year = \$6, +\$2 third year =
             \$8, +\$2 for fourth year = \$10). Rose is released into
             the veteran auction pool as a RFA with a starting bid of
             \$10. Bob’s 3rd round pick is 3.06, and in a trade prior
             to Rose’s auction, he acquires pick 3.01. Rose’s auction
             concludes with a final bid of \$30 by Bob. Shortly after
             Rose’s auction concludes, Bob acquires pick 3.11 in a
             trade. Joe declines to re-sign Rose at \$27 (\$30 - \$3
             RFA exception), so Bob must forfeit a 3rd round pick or
             better to Joe. Of his 3rd round picks, Bob may choose to
             forfeit 3.01 or 3.06 only; 3.11 is not eligible to be
             forfeited since it was acquired after the final bid was
             made by Joe.

3.  RFA mechanics

    a.  As a RFA, the player’s starting bid is equal to his 4th year
         salary (3rd year salary + usual increase). The player’s
         original owner cannot bid in the auction for the player.

    b.  RFA process:

        i.  After the auction for an RFA concludes, the winning bidder
             has 48 hours to optionally raise the final bid on the
             player. No response in 48 hours defaults as no raised bid.

        ii. After either a declaration of raise or no raise, or 48 hours
             have elapsed with no response, the original owner has 48
             hours to match the bid (with the RFA exception), or
             decline and take the draft pick compensation (compensatory
             pick is specified by the winning owner after original
             owner declines). No response in 48 hours defaults as no
             match.

        iii. If the final bid is matched, the original owner re-signs
             the player with a 10% discount for the RFA exception. If
             the final bid is not matched, the winning owner signs the
             player at a salary equal to the final bid, and forfeits
             the required draft pick to the original owner immediately.

    c.  An owner may not make a bid (or raise a winning bid) on a
         player, that would require him to forfeit a pick he doesn’t
         have, if the original owner were to decline match and take the
         draft pick compensation.

    d.  After an RFA auction is concluded, but before the RFA process is
         resolved, the winning owner is considered to be the winning
         bidder for the player, for purposes of determining cap
         available to spend in other auctions.

    e.  If an RFA player is not bid on, then the original owner has the
         option of re-signing the player to a 4th year, for the usual
         4th year salary. The original owner does not get an RFA
         exception in this case. If the player was not bid on and the
         original owner declines to re-sign the player, the player goes
         into the veteran free agent pool and can be bid on in the
         Veteran Auction. In this case, if and when he is won in
         auction, he is now on a new veteran contract, regardless of
         which owner wins the player.

    f.  If an RFA player is re-signed by the original owner, he has a
         maximum 5 year contract (2 years after being re-signed as
         RFA), after which the player is released into the veteran
         auction pool as an unrestricted free agent (UFA). The original
         owner is allowed to bid on a UFA. As a UFA, he will be slotted
         into the veteran auction as if he were a normal free agent;
         however, the original owner gets a UFA veteran exception. See
         *16. Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA)*.

4.  RFA rights ownership

    a.  If a player is traded during the first three years of his
         contract after being signed in the rookie draft, his RFA
         benefits are retained by the new owner. However, if a player
         is dropped and then picked up again, he is now considered to
         have a new contract and be signed via the veteran auction, and
         thus does not retain RFA benefits.

    b.  The owner that gets a player’s RFA exception in the next Veteran
         Auction is the owner of the player at the time of the keeper
         deadline, when RFAs and UFAs are announced.

**16. Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA)**

1.  Explanation

    a.  Unrestricted Free Agent (UFA): Player that is coming off 3rd
         year of a V contract or 5th year of a R contract. This player
         may not be kept at the standard 20% salary increase and goes
         into the Veteran Auction as a 3-year UFA or 5-year UFA, with
         the original owner getting a UFA Veteran Exception as detailed
         below.

2.  Veteran Exception

    a.  Veteran Exception: all UFAs have veteran exceptions in the form
         of re-signing discounts to the original owners. The veteran
         exceptions are as below:

        i.  previously 5 year contract: 20% discount off of final bid,
             rounded up, maximum \$8

        ii. previously 3 year contract: 10% discount off of final bid,
             rounded up, maximum \$5

    b.  The veteran exception cannot bring a player’s salary below the
         \$1 minimum salary.

    c.  A veteran exception means that if the original owner wins an
         auction for the player, he gets the specified discount on the
         player’s salary, based on if the player was a 5-year UFA or
         3-year UFA. If the player is traded, he still has the salary
         with the discount, the salary does not go back up to the final
         bid amount.

        i.  example 1: Blake Griffin is a 5-year UFA, previously owned
             by Joe. Joe wins Griffin’s auction for a final bid of
             \$34. The veteran exception is a 20% rounded up discount
             off of the final bid, which is \$7 (.20 \* \$34 = \$6.80,
             rounded up to \$7). Joe gets Griffin’s veteran exception
             and signs him for \$34-\$7 = \$27. If he trades Griffin,
             Griffin’s salary will continue to be \$27.

        ii. example 2: Brandon Jennings is a 3-year UFA, previously
             owned by Bob. Bob wins Jennings’ auction for a final bid
             of \$13. The veteran exception is a 10% rounded up
             discount off of the final bid, which is \$2 (.10 \* \$13 =
             \$1.30, rounded up to \$2). Bob gets Jennings’ veteran
             exception and signs him for \$13-\$2 = \$11. If he trades
             Jennings, Jennings’s salary will continue to be \$11.

    d.  All UFA veteran exceptions transfer to the new owner if a player
         is traded before becoming a UFA. Thus, the new owner gets the
         player’s veteran exception for 3-year UFAs and 5-year UFAs.
         However, if a player is dropped and then re-signed via
         in-season free agency, he is considered to have a brand new
         contract, and be a first year player, and thus is not eligible
         for a veteran exception.

        i.  example 1: Blake Griffin is in his 5th year (originally
             signed via rookie draft, then re-signed as RFA) on Joe’s
             team, and is traded to Bob right before the trade
             deadline. After the season is over (assuming Griffin is
             not traded again before the keeper deadline), Bob gets
             Blake Griffin’s 5-year UFA veteran exception in next
             year’s veteran auction.

        ii. example 2: Brandon Jennings is in his 3rd year (originally
             signed via veteran auction) on Bob’s team. Jennings is
             dropped by Bob, and then picked up by Joe one week later.
             Jennings now is in the 1st year of his contract, and if
             not kept, does not have a veteran exception in next year’s
             veteran auction.

3.  Contract Type

    a.  Any re-signed UFA is considered to be signed through the veteran
         auction (for purposes of maximum contract length and UFA
         designation) and have a brand new contract in year 1 (for
         purposes of UFA veteran exceptions).

4.  UFA rights ownership

    a.  The owner that gets a player’s UFA veteran exception in the next
         Veteran Auction is the owner of the player at the time of the
         keeper deadline, when RFAs and UFAs are announced.

**VI. RULES CHANGES AND SCHEDULE**

**19. Possible Future Rules Changes**

1.  Explanation

    a.  There are some possible future rules additions based on whether
         the league as a whole is comfortable with the salary cap and
         auction style of play, which would increase the strategy
         involved in the league. Most of these potential rules
         additions are major changes that would be implemented with at
         least a year in advance notice, to allow owners to adjust
         their strategy. Any such changes would be discussed and the
         rules ironed out so that the transition is smooth and attempts
         to equally impact all owners as much as possible.

2.  List of Possible Rules Changes

    a.  Relaxation or removal of keeper restrictions

    b.  Rules for exceeding cap for veteran contracts (similar to NBA
         rules)

    c.  Trading current + future cap space (would have specific limits,
         e.g. +/- \$20 max current year, +/- \$10 max next two years)

    d.  14 team and 16 team expansions (2 team expansion draft where you
         can protect a certain number of your players, and continue
         protecting more as players are drafted)

    e.  Team Option – once each season, can extend a 3rd/5th year player
         one more year with no standard 20% raise, is still treated as
         a 3rd/5th year player

    f.  Player Option – once each season, one player has a player
         option. Have a way of determining the 8th-10th best player
         value on your team (e.g., pick 7-9 players to protect, then
         everyone picks one player from all other teams, and then the
         owner selects one of those players to have a player option).
         That player is released into the FA pool at a minimum bid of
         his current salary + \$1. If he is bid on, then he can be
         retained at the new salary, if declined, the winning bidder
         wins him at the new salary. If he is not bid on, he remains on
         his original team at the original salary.

    g.  Adding fixed contract lengths (would probably be slowly
         implemented – e.g., adding contract lengths for \~33% of
         players each year over 3 years). This would be one of the most
         significant rules changes, and would require careful
         deliberation before implementing.

    h.  Contract options (only after fixed contract lengths are added) –
         team/player options, extensions, early termination, buyouts,
         etc.

**20. Planned Future Rules Changes**

1.  Explanation

    a.  The rules for this league will continue to evolve, with an aim
         at integrating rules changes slowly, such that any previous
         moves made by owners would not have changed to account for the
         changed rules. This section will list planned future rules
         changes that have been discussed and/or voted upon by the
         league.

**21. Past Rules Changes**

1.  Explanation

    a.  This section will list any rules changes from previous seasons,
         for reference purposes.

2.  2010-2011 (inaugural season)

    a.  In the inaugural season only, NBA lottery rookies (the first 14
         drafted players in the NBA draft) will also be eligible to be
         bid on in the Veteran Auction. This is allowed to mitigate the
         advantage of having an early rookie draft pick in the
         inaugural season, when there are no previous years standings
         to go off of and draft order will be random. However, these
         rookies won via auction will still be considered to be signed
         via the Rookie Draft for contract purposes.

    b.  For the inaugural season, since there are no previous year
         records to determine draft order, we will use a different
         format. There will be a random draw to determine draft order.
         The draft will then go as follows:

        i.  1st round: in order of random draw, from Team 1 to Team 12

        ii. 2nd round: in reverse order of random draw, from Team 12 to
             Team 1

        iii. 3rd round: in reverse order of random draw, from Team 12 to
             Team 1 (same as 2nd round)

        iv. 4th round: in order of random draw, from Team 1 to Team 12
             (same as 1st round)

        v.  There will be no 5th round in the inaugural season

    c.  For the inaugural season, since NBA lottery rookies are eligible
         to be bid on in the Veteran Auction, the Rookie Draft will
         consist of all non-lottery rookies and all lottery rookies
         that were not bid on in the Veteran Auction, in addition to
         other undrafted players eligible for the rookie draft.

    d.  The salaries by round for the inaugural season will also be
         different. 1st round picks will have a \$4 salary, 2nd round
         picks will have a \$3 salary, 3rd round picks will have a \$2
         salary, and 4th round picks will have a \$1 salary.

3.  2012-2013

    a.  Added Development Squad/RD contract type

    b.  Reduced Rookie Draft salaries – Rookie Draft salaries reduced to
         \$4 for 1st round, \$3 to 2nd round, \$2 for 3rd round, \$1
         for 4th round, and \$1 for 5th round.
